# Implementation Summary

## WebSocket Client with MessagePack Support

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive WebSocket client that can:

1. Connect to a WebSocket server endpoint (`localhost:8082/msgpack`)
2. Serialize messages in MessagePack format according to the expected Rust structure
3. Send different types of messages (SpawnDummy, SetClientFPS, DummySetVelocity)
4. Receive and interpret responses from the server

## Implementation Variants

We created three client implementations with increasing capabilities:

1. **compact_websocket.cpp** - Basic WebSocket client with simple response display
2. **improved_websocket_client.cpp** - Client with enhanced MessagePack response visualization
3. **advanced_websocket_client.cpp** - Client with detailed response deserialization and type-specific handling

## Key Features

- **Message Serialization**: Properly formats MessagePack data for compatibility with the Rust server
- **Response Handling**: Interprets binary MessagePack responses and extracts structured data
- **User Interface**: Interactive menu for selecting message types and parameters
- **Debugging Tools**: Hex dump visualization, ASCII representation, and structured MessagePack interpretation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for connection issues and parsing problems

## Next Steps

The following improvements could be made in future iterations:

1. **Authentication Integration**: Connect with the AuthProxy authentication system as described in the feature request
2. **Connection Persistence**: Add support for long-lived connections with multiple message exchanges
3. **More Message Types**: Implement additional message types as required by the server
4. **Advanced Error Recovery**: Add retry mechanisms and more sophisticated error handling

## Documentation

We've created comprehensive documentation:

1. **README.md** - General overview and usage instructions
2. **message_structures.md** - Detailed C++ MessagePack structure documentation
3. **response_handling.md** - Specific documentation for response parsing implementation

## Usage

The client can be run using the provided shell script:

```bash
# For the standard client
./run.sh

# For the improved client
./run.sh improved

# For the advanced client
./run.sh advanced
```

Each client implementation offers different levels of response interpretation capabilities, allowing developers to choose the appropriate level of detail for their needs.
